Created Predictive Time Series model for inventory forecasting so that service centre achieve JIT standards.

# Bajaj Client Project

## Description
Keeping inventory of spare parts in various service centers to match market demand is a significant challenge. Most service centers incur substantial costs in spare parts inventory, yet availability remains an issue. This project aims to develop a predictive model for inventory forecasting to help service centers achieve Just-In-Time (JIT) standards.

## Project Goal
Create a predictive model for inventory forecasting so that service centers can optimize spare parts availability and achieve JIT standards.

## Domain Analysis
- **Invoice Date**: The date when the agency received the invoice through any state location. The receipt date is when the services were received or contractually due.
- **Job Card Date**: A job card details the work performed for a work order, created and managed in the Job Cards application.
- **Business Partner Name**: Name of the business partner.
- **Vehicle No**: Vehicle number.
- **Vehicle Model**: A car's make (brand) and model (product name/range).
- **Current KM Reading**: The odometer reading before servicing.
- **Invoice Line Text**: A description of the product or service invoiced, typically including price and quantity.

## Features
- Predictive inventory forecasting for spare parts.
- Cost reduction by optimizing spare parts availability.
- Improved service center efficiency with JIT inventory management.
